An interactive academic dashboard built using Microsoft Excel with the power of Pivot Tables, Charts, and Slicers 📊🧠
This dashboard gives a comprehensive view of student performance, analyzing key aspects like:
✔️ Average Total Score by Department
✔️ Grade Distribution
✔️ Study Hours vs. Grades
✔️ Sleep Patterns vs. Academic Scores
✔️ Stress Level Insights
✔️ Participation, Projects, and More!
The goal was not just to analyze data, but to make it meaningful and visually engaging. I used slicers to add interactivity so that users can filter results by gender, department, or grade in just a click 🎯
This project helped me strengthen my skills in data analysis and visualization, and gave me a deeper appreciation for how insights can drive better understanding and decisions.
